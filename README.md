Library Management System (LMS)
-	A system for managing books, borrowers, and library operations.

How to install:
-	Java IDE: Eclipse  

-	Download all files. (class "MP01" file at SacdalanMP01/src/MP01)

-	Create a folder and locate all files in one folder named “SacdalanMP01”.

-	Add to package “MP01”.

-	Run the program.

Instructions: 
-	Assume  you are the librarian, and no other users will be using the system.

-	All I/O are in the terminal.

-	Enter the index of the desired function:

    o	Book checkout and return.
        -	To checkout and return: ENTER INDEX 1: TO RETURN AND CHECKOUT, and choose between checkout or return in the next option, INDEX 1 or 2, respectively.

    o	Reservation and queue management for popular books.
        -	Follows the queue system and automatically reserves anyone who wishes to checkout.

    o	Fine calculation and management for overdue books.
        -	Calculated fine function follows: duration of borrowing only for 10 seconds and 1 Philippine peso per interval overdue time, 5 seconds.

-	Other options to consider:
    o	Displays the array of all books: ENTER INDEX 0.

    o	Displays a binary tree representation of all books: ENTER INDEX 3.

    o	Allows the capability of searching book titles through binary tree nodes: ENTER INDEX 4.

    o	Displays an adjacency list representing a graph of borrow history and relationships per book: ENTER INDEX 2.

    o	Displays an iteration-by-iteration output of a sorted list of the titles of the books: ENTER INDEX 1; also proceeds to return and checkout.
    
    o   Exit terminal: ENTER INDEX 5.
